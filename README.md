# Backend

## Creating the backend structure

The goal for the backend is to create a database with atleast two tables:  

 - One for the products  
 - One for the users
 
The products displayed on your front-end will be fetched from this database and all users will be stored here. 

You can choose to use the **MVC structure** for you project or create an **API** to connect your front-end.
